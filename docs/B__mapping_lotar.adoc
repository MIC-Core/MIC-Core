== Mapping of MIC-Core to LOTAR standard

This appendix is an optional part of the MIC-Core specification. 
It provides a mapping of the MIC-Core standard attributes to the attributes of the LOTAR standard.

=== Introduction

LOTAR stands for **Long-term archiving and retrieval (LOTAR)**. 
It was initiated by the aircraft industry. Aircraft have very long lifecycles. There can be 80 years between the initial design for a new program and the end of life of the last one delivered. 
Throughout the product lifecycle, the data defined for archiving and retrieval must be provided in a standardized format that can be read and reused regardless of changes to the original IT environment. 
Ensuring the on-going use of the original data and models is the goal of LOTAR. 
The LOTAR MBSE Metadata Manifest was created to support the integration of models from multiple domains and was originally derived from the MIC and the MoSSEC (Modeling and Simulation information in a collaborative Systems Engineering Context) standards. 
Additional information and related LOTAR standards are in the section “Information about LOTAR”.

In the following, the mapping of the MIC-Core standard attributes to the attributes of the LOTAR standard will be shown.

=== Maping of MIC-Core attributes to the LOTAR standard

The following table shows the mapping of MIC-Core attributes to LOTAR attributes.
In the first column the attributes defined in the MIC-Core are listed.
The second column lists the mapping of the attribute names to the LOTAR attributes.
In column three an abbreviated explanation of the attributes is listed to provide a better overview.

| Model supplier | Organisation | The responsible body and, if applicable, organizational unit within the body, that is responsible for supplying the model.
| Model confidentiality level | accessControl | Protection level to apply to the model.
| Legal restriction | distributionMarking | Defines the rules governing the distribution and usage of the simulation model, including licensing,
| Release | baselineProductID | Unique identifier, preferably human-readable (i.e. semantically meaningfull), for the release of a particular simulation model.
| Release date | approvalDate | Date, and possibly time and timezone, of the release of a simulation model. Must respect ISO 8601.
| Release type| maturityState | Relates to the maturity of the model.
| Model purpose | modelPurpose | Purpose for which the model has been built/validated.
| Modelled entity | systemDesignation | Name or description of the object represented by the simulation model.
| Modeling choice | method | Explanation of the modeling choices, assumptions or simplifications made during the implementation of the model.

| Verification status | qualityVerificationAssessmentLevel | Indicates whether a given verification procedure has been followed to successfully reach verification criteria.
| Validation status | qualityValidationAssessmentLevel | Indicates whether a given validation procedure has been followed to successfully reach validation criteria.
| Verification & Validation procedure and criteria | validationScenarioID | Steps and methods followed as well as criteria to reach. Verification and validation can be covered together or separately.
| Verification & Validation report | modelSummaryReport | Reports describing the results of the verification and validation.

=== Detailing about mapping MIC-Core to LOTARR

As in chapter 1.2 descripted, the MIC-Core standard defines a set of core attributes that other standards can adopt, extend, refine. 
Goal is to have a core set of aligned attributes. All the standards have specific use cases; therefore they also have more specific attributes to support these use cases. As an example:

MIC-Core has the attribute **Software and hardware environment requirements** which fits to the LOTAR attribute **ModelDev_Integration_Execution_Inf2**. 
But LOTAR has also more specific attributes in this context like: devToolName, devToolVersion, devToolLicense, devOSname, devOSversion, devOSlicense, devCompilerName, devCompilerVersion, devCompilerLicense, devLanguage, CPUnumber, RAMsize, targetToolName

=== Information about LOTAR

**LOTAR International https://lotar-international.org/**  is a project being conducted by leading OEMs, suppliers, and solution providers in the aerospace and defense industry under the joint auspices of Aerospace Industries Association of America (AIA), the AeroSpace and Defense Industries Association of Europe for Standardization (ASD-STAN), PDES, Inc., and the prostep ivip association. 
Based on the ISO 14721, the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) Reference Model, the LOTAR organization is divided into domain workgroups.

The business case for data preservation is more than data reuse and includes regulatory requirements, accident investigations, product support and modifications, part/design obsolescence, software fixes, and the evolution of tools.

The Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) workgroup is focused on delivering process instructions for specific model types.  In addition to general modeling and quality standards, the instructions identify data standards applicable to the individual modeling domains. Examples include ReqIF, NAS-STD-7009B, FMI/SSP, SysMLv2, AP243, RDF/OWL/OSLC.
