== Mapping of MIC-Core to LOTAR standard

This appendix is an optional part of the MIC-Core specification.
It provides an mapping of the MIC-Core standard attributes to the attributes of the LOTAR standard.

=== Introduction

In the following, the mapping of the MIC-Core standard attributes to the attributes of the LOTAR standard will be shown.

**Breef explanation of LOTAR**.

LOTAR stands for **Long-term archiving and retrieval (LOTAR)**
It was initiated by teh aircraft industry.
Aircraft have very long lifecycles. There can be 80 years between the initial design for a new program and the end of life of the last one delivered. Throughout the product lifecycle, the data defined for archiving and retrieval must be provided in a standardized format that can be read and reused regardless of changes to the original IT environment. Ensuring this is the goal of LOTAR.
Additional information and related standards to LOTAR are in chapter Information about LOTAR

=== Maping of MIC-Core attributes to the LOTAR standard

The following table shows the mapping of MIC-Core attributes to LOTAR attributes.
In the first column the attributes defined in the MIC-Core are listed.
The second column lists the mapping of the attribute names to the LOTAR attributes.
In column three an abbreviated explanation of the attributes is listed to provide a better overview.

| MIC-Core Name| LOTAR Mapping | Short Explanation
| Model name | modelName | Human-readable way of referring to the model. Usually short and clear. Not necessarily unique
| Model identifier | Unique_object_id | Unique identifier for the model.
| Model description | modelObjective | Human-readable, textual, general overview. Highlights important information about the model.
| Model supplier | Organisation | The responsible body and, if applicable, organizational unit within the body, that is responsible for supplying the model.
| Model confidentiality level | accessControl | Protection level to apply to the model.
| Legal restriction | distributionMarking | Defines the rules governing the distribution and usage of the simulation model, including licensing,
| Release | baselineProductID | Unique identifier, preferably human-readable (i.e. semantically meaningfull), for the release of a particular simulation model.
| Release date | approvalDate | Date, and possibly time and timezone, of the release of a simulation model. Must respect ISO 8601.
| Release type| maturityState | Relates to the maturity of the model.
| Model purpose | modelPurpose | Purpose for which the model has been built/validated.
| Modelled entity | systemDesignation | Name or description of the object represented by the simulation model.
| Modeling choice | method | Explanation of the modeling choices, assumptions or simplifications made during the implementation of the model.
| Model limitations | validityRange | Restrictions on the use of the model.
| Model classification | physicsDomain | Keyword-based classifications of the model in terms, for example, of physics, engineering or implementation.
| Software and hardware environment requirements | ModelDev_Integration_Execution_Inf2 | Requirements regarding the software and hardware environment of the model.
| Verification status | qualityVerificationAssessmentLevel | Indicates whether a given verification procedure has been followed to successfully reach verification criteria.
| Validation status | qualityValidationAssessmentLevel | Indicates whether a given validation procedure has been followed to successfully reach validation criteria.
| Verification & Validation procedure and criteria | validationScenarioID | Steps and methods followed as well as criteria to reach. Verification and validation can be covered together or separately.
| Verification & Validation report | modelSummaryReport | Reports describing the results of the verification and validation.
