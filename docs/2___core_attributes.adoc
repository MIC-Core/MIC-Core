TODO: Description of all core attributes in long form, tabular summary will be auto-generated.

=== Administrative data

==== Model name

Attribute category:: Administrative data

Attribute descroption:: Human-readable way of referring to the model. Usually short and clear. Not necessarily unique. To be distinguished from the model identifier and file name.

Cardinality:: 1 (mandatory)

Value entry examples::

* Electric motor/generator

* parametrized motor

* Permanent magnet DC machine

* 2nd order mass

Additional explanation and rationale:: From a user's perspective, the model name is the most important characteristic of a model. A model name is easier to remember than a generic identifier, and when users want to search for or retrieve models, they search primarily by model name. When models are imported into a data management system, the system typically expects a model name as a mandatory attribute. 

==== Model identifier

Attribute category:: Administrative data

Attribute description:: Unique identifier for the model. Possibly only locally unique. May not be specific to a given version of the model. The syntax and interpretation of the identifier is not standardized and open to the implementer. Can for example be based on a URI, a model path, or a UUID.

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* part.Engine.combustion.BMW_S58Engine

* 4fc009cc-2dae-4df9-b6b2-0b535038c8e8

* //server/home/user/models/mymodel

Additional explanation and rationale:: The model identifier, unlike the model name, is typically unchangeable and usually unique within an IT system's number range. This means that if a model is sent multiple times, it can have a different version number each time, while the model identifier is the same. Thus, the model identifier can be used to identify different model versions as versions of the same model, or to identify that there are two versions of different models. The model identifier is the most important and decisive attribute when importing models into a data management system and therefore must be provided for technical reasons.

==== Model description

Attribute category:: Administrative data

Attribute description:: Human readable, textual, general overview. Highlights important information about the model. May include some information formalized in other attributes, without expectation of completeness. 

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples:: For the recipient of a simulation model, a textual description or summary of the model's contents and possible uses may be helpful. A quick overview avoids having to look at all the attributes.

* This model simulates the heat exchange between S58 engine and cooling system

* DRVELMT01 is a model of electric motor/generator with its converter. The output torque and power losses can be determined either by using data files or  characteristic parameters. This model is bidirectional.

Additional explanation and rationale:: Submitting this attribute is recommended to help the receiver of the model understand the model.

==== Release 

Attribute description:: Preferably human-readable, unique identifier for the release of a particular simulation model. Required to distinguish between different releases of models. Represents the result of the intentional act of releasing a model at a particular stage to a particular audience (different from the more general notion of version).

Cardinality:: 1 (mandatory)

Value entry examples::

* V3.2.4
* 0.1a
* 1.2.0-alpha.1+build.x64.010
* Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044
* 1.9.9.12-DB:C5:D9:3F:DA:19:C5:82:40:80:8B:A5:33:A4:DC:5F


Additional explanation and rationale:: The release should be specified in any case to help the recipient of the model to distinguish between different releases. The specification of the release is also important to facilitate the communication of development partners regarding the model.

==== Release date

Attribute description::  Date on which a simulation model was released. Must respect ISO 8601.

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* 2023-03-27T12:27:04Z

Additional explanation and rationale:: If there are multiple releases of a model and the releases do not differ in name, the release date is often a helpful differentiator. It may also be possible to determine which release is the most recent. Therefore, it is recommended to include the release date to assist the recipients of the release.

==== Release type

Attribute description::  Relates to the maturity of the model. To be distinguished from a changing status (e.g. outdated). Fixed at the time of the release and not changing. Allows the receiver to evaluate the usage limitations of a given release (e.g. a prelease shall not be used for final system validation).

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* internal-release

* pre-release

* * production release

* only for demonstration

* *_Bad examples:_* outdated, optimization model

Additional explanation and rationale:: Specifying the release type gives the receiver of the release an indication of the status that the sender of the release assigns to the release.

==== Model supplier

Attribute description::  The responsible body and, if applicable, organizational unit within the body, that is responsible for supplying the model. Can be different from the owner or the creator of the model. Should be defined in a durable way, avoiding for example specific people names.  Relevant personal data protection guidelines should be takend into account. In case of model assembly, responsible of the overall assembly.

Cardinality:: 1 (mandatory)

Value entry examples::

* company Z, department SD

* company-Z-models@dd.com

* www.company-Z/models

* personal data, e.g. company Z, Peter Miller can be problematic

Additional explanation and rationale:: The attribute is classified as mandatory because it is very important to know who provided the model, and because it is important to be able to contact the model provider in case of questions about the model. Otherwise, the use of the model may be made very difficult or even impossible.



==== Model confidentiality level

Attribute description::  Protection level to apply to the model. Does not specify the organizational scope. Does not define what a receiver is allowed to do or is not allowed to do. Values should be "0: public", "1: internal", "2: confidential" or "3: strictly confidential".  Additional processes and tools are required to ensure confidentiality.

Note: Reference to ISO/IEC 27010:2015

Cardinality:: 1 (mandatory)

Value entry examples::

* 0: public
* 1: internal
* 2: confidential 
* 3: strictly confidential

Additional explanation and rationale:: While trust level specification is less relevant for cross-enterprise model exchange, it is all the more relevant for intra-enterprise sharing. Therefore, it is considered mandatory.

==== Legal restriction

Attribute description::  Defines the rules governing the distribution and usage of the simulation model in the form of an open field: royalties to pay, restriction to noncommercial use, right to modify, related legal contract, etc.

Avoids a special field for licences

Cardinality:: 0..inf (optional)

Value entry examples::

* Company Z confidential
* GPL
* License MIT
* Legal contract #0987654321

Additional explanation and rationale:: Information about legal restrictions can help avoid legal uncertainties in the use of models. However, since such restrictions do not always exist, this attribute is optional.

==== Model purpose

Attribute description::  Purpose for which the model has been built/validated. Free textual field for human-readable description in short words  

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* Minimization of the maximum value of an engine's energy consumption 

* Evaluation of the average breaking distance under uncertain weather conditions

* Automated driving function validation in an OEM environment at object-list level

* Efficency evaluation of a gear box in combination with a SW-function

Additional explanation and rationale:: Specifying the model purpose is not technically mandatory, but it is one of the most important from a user perspective. Therefore, the model purpose is classified as recommended.

==== Modelled entity

Attribute description::  Name or description of the object represented by the simulation model

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* Camera
* Gear box type xyz23
* Electrical car, model X, version Y, configuration Z

Additional explanation and rationale:: If something is to be simulated, a simulation model is usually created from a section of the real world. The search for the suitable model for a simulation always takes place in relation to the object to be simulated. Therefore, the Modeled entity attribute is recommended.

==== Modeling choice

Attribute description::  Explanation of the modeling choices, assumptions or simplifications made during implementation of the model. It should include: 

1) effects or phenomena covered  introduced in general terms, such as vibration of thermal effects, and detailed;

2) how they are covered (in an acausal approach, with a look-up table based on experimental data, etc.).

3) typical keywords which permit to facilitate information retrieval (e.g. “Causal”, “Acausal”, “Bond graph”, “Transfer function”).

Cardinality:: 0..inf (recommended)

Value entry examples::

Note: As this attribute can have multiple values, some of the examples below could apply together to the same model:

* Sensor model is purely object-list driven

* Weather effects are not modelled.

* Typical hydraulic fluid is used, the medium is isotropic

* Acausal thermal and electrical modelling with through and accross variables

* The car is represented as a single track model

* The motor is modeled with a look-up table based on experimental data 

Additional explanation and rationale:: Information about the modeling choice helps to understand, how the model was created and to decide weather these comply to the intended usage of the model in a certain use case. Hence, it is recommended to Provide thes information to a recepient. 

==== Modeling limitations

Attribute description::  Restrictions on the use of the model within the given scope of the model purpose that are not self-evident or not immediately apparent to a user (e.g. when the model provides an incorrect result). 

Cardinality:: 0..inf (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* The model is only valid between 0 and 50 degrees temperature

* Not real-time capable

* The model provides incorrect results at low speeds

* Eddy currents are neglected

* Thermal effects are not considered

Additional explanation and rationale:: The meaning of this attribute is similar to that of the Model Purpose attribute. When searching for a model, it is important to know what the model is intended to do, but it is also important to know what the model is not intended to do. Therefore, the use of this attribute will recommend what it is 

==== Model classification

Attribute description::  Classifications of the model in terms, for example, of physics, engineering or implementation. Can refer to standard or locally standard schemes. It is recommended to refer to a scheme with the reverse domain notation prefix.

Cardinality:: 0..inf (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* Linear

* org.modelica.causality.acausal

* org.iso.is11010-1.vhm.2-1

Additional explanation and rationale:: The use of the attribute is recommended because further properties of the model may be transported via the classifications. However, the use basically depends on whether further properties are to be described.

==== Verification status

Attribute description::  Indicates whether a given verification procedure has been followed to successfully reach verification criteria. Verification permits to confirm that a simulation technically works (code without bug, convergence of discretized models, etc.).

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* has been verified

* has not be verified

Additional explanation and rationale:: Knowing he verification status is essential to decide about trusting the model quality with respect to the given specification. Hence, it is recommended to provuide the status if, available.

==== Validation status

Attribute description::  Indicates whether a given validation procedure has been followed to successfully reach validation criteria. Validation permits to confirm that a simulation fulfills user needs. For example, validation permits to confirm that a simulation is close enough (which depends on the user needs) to a reference.

Cardinality:: 0..1 (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* has been validated

* has not been validated

* validated with limitations

Additional explanation and rationale:: Knowing he validation status is essential to decide about trusting the model quality with respect to the intended usesage of the model. Hence, it is recommended to provuide the status if, available.

==== Verification & Validation procedure and criteria

Attribute description:: Steps and methods followed as well as criteria to reach. Verification and validation can be covered together or separately.

Cardinality:: 0..inf (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* ASME VV10

* ASME VV40

* Turing Test

* Graphical Comparisons 

* Boundary Analysis

Additional explanation and rationale:: A Inspecting the criteria may help deciding wheather the validation and verification citeria applied fulfill the expectatioons in detail with respect to the intended usage in a certain use case. Hence, it is recommended to provuide the ceteria if, available.

==== Verification & Validation report

Attribute description:: Reports describing the results of the verification and validation. Verification and validation can be covered together or separately. Can be summaries, to facilitate communication and distribution.

Typically, it is a link to a report.

Cardinality:: 0..inf (recommended)

Value entry examples::

* link Report XS

Additional explanation and rationale:: A Inspecting the reports may help deciding wheather the validation and verification fulfill the expectatioons in detail with respect to the intended usage in a certain use case. Hence, it is recommended to provuide the report if, available.
