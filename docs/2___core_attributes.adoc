TODO: Description of all core attributes in long form, tabular summary will be auto-generated.

=== Model name

Attribute description:: Human-readable way of referring to the model. Usually short and clear. Not necessarily unique. To be distinguished from the model identifier and file name.

Filling:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value examples::

* Electric motor/generator

* Mapped Motor

* Permanent magnet DC machine

* 2nd order mass

Additional explanation and rationale:: From a user's perspective, the model name is an important characteristic of a model. A model name is easier to remember than an identifier, and model names play an important role when searching for or retrieving models. When models are imported into a data management system, the system typically expects a model name as a mandatory attribute. 

=== Model identifier

Attribute description:: Unique identifier for the model. Possibly only locally unique, within a given IT system. May not be specific to a given release of the model. The syntax and interpretation of the identifier is not standardized and open to the implementer. Can for example be based on a URI, a model path, or a UUID.

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* part.Engine.combustion.BMW_S58Engine

* 4fc009cc-2dae-4df9-b6b2-0b535038c8e8

* //server/home/user/models/mymodel

Additional explanation and rationale:: The model identifier, unlike the model name, is typically unchangeable. Different releases of a model may have the same model identifier is the same. In this case, both the model identifier and the model release are required for model desambiguation.

=== Model description

Attribute description:: Human-readable, textual, general overview. Highlights important information about the model. May include some information formalized in other attributes, without expectation of completeness. 

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples:: 

* This model simulates the heat exchange between S58 engine and cooling system

* DRVELMT01 is a model of electric motor/generator with its converter. The output torque and power losses can be determined either by using data files or  characteristic parameters. This model is bidirectional.

Additional explanation and rationale:: For the recipient of a simulation model, a textual description or summary of the model's contents and possible uses may be helpful. A quick overview avoids having to look at all the attributes.

=== Release 

Attribute description:: Unique identifier for the release of a particular simulation model. Represents the result of the intentional act of releasing a model at a particular stage to a particular audience (different from the more general notion of version).

Filling:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* V3.2.4
* 0.1a
* 1.2.0-alpha.1+build.x64.010
* Version 10.0.19044 Build 19044
* 1.9.9.12-DB:C5:D9:3F:DA:19:C5:82:40:80:8B:A5:33:A4:DC:5F

Additional explanation and rationale:: A human-readable release can help the recipient of the model and, more generally, the development stakeholders.

=== Release date

Attribute description::  Date on which a simulation model was released. Must respect ISO 8601.

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* 2023-03-27T12:27:04Z

=== Release type

Attribute description::  Relates to the maturity of the model. To be distinguished from a changing status (e.g. outdated). Fixed at the time of the release and not changing. Allows the receiver to evaluate the usage limitations of a given release (e.g. a prelease shall not be used for final system validation).

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* internal-release

* pre-release

* production release

* only for demonstration

=== Model supplier

Attribute description::  The responsible body that is responsible for supplying the model. Can be different from the owner or the creator of the model. Should be as specific as possible but also durable, avoiding for example specific people names. Relevant personal data protection guidelines should be takend into account. In case of model assembly, responsible of the overall assembly.

Filling:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* company Z, department SD

* company-Z-models@dd.com

* www.company-Z/models

* personal data, e.g. company Z, Peter Miller can be problem

Additional explanation and rationale:: The attribute is classified as mandatory because it is very important to know who provided the model, and because it is important to be able to contact the model provider in case of questions about the model.

=== Model confidentiality level

Attribute description:: Protection level to apply to the model. Does not specify the organizational scope. Does not define what a receiver is allowed to do or is not allowed to do. Values should be "0: public", "1: internal", "2: confidential" or "3: strictly confidential".  Additional processes and tools are required to ensure confidentiality.

Filling:: Mandatory

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* 0: public
* 1: internal
* 2: confidential 
* 3: strictly confidential

Additional explanation and rationale:: While such level is less relevant for cross-enterprise model exchange, it is highly relevant for intra-enterprise sharing.

=== Legal restriction

Attribute description::  Defines the rules governing the distribution and usage of the simulation model, including licensing, in the form of an open field: royalties to pay, restriction to noncommercial use, right to modify, related legal contract, etc.

Filling:: Optional

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* Company Z confidential
* GPL
* License MIT
* Legal contract #0987654321

Additional explanation and rationale:: Information about legal restrictions can help avoid legal uncertainties in the use of models. However, since such restrictions do not always exist, this attribute is optional.

=== Model purpose

Attribute description::  Purpose for which the model has been built/validated. Free textual field for short human-readable description.

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* Minimization of the maximum value of an engine's energy consumption 

* Evaluation of the average breaking distance under uncertain weather conditions

* Automated driving function validation in an OEM environment at object-list level

* Efficency evaluation of a gear box in combination with a SW-function

=== Modelled entity

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* Camera
* Gear box type xyz23
* Electrical car, model X, version Y, configuration Z

=== Modeling choice

Attribute description::  Explanation of the modeling choices, assumptions or simplifications made during the implementation of the model. It should include: 

1) effects or phenomena covered  introduced in general terms, such as vibration of thermal effects, and detailed;

2) how they are covered (in an acausal approach, with a look-up table based on experimental data, etc.).

3) typical keywords which permit to facilitate information retrieval (e.g. “Causal”, “Acausal”, “Bond graph”, “Transfer function”).

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

Note: As this attribute can have multiple values, some of the examples below could apply together to the same model:

* Sensor model is purely object-list driven

* Weather effects are not modelled.

* Typical hydraulic fluid is used, the medium is isotropic

* Acausal thermal and electrical modelling with through and accross variables

* The car is represented as a single track model

* The motor is modeled with a look-up table based on experimental data 

=== Modeling limitations

Attribute description::  Restrictions on the use of the model. Especially important if these restrictions are not self-evident to a user (e.g. when the model provides an incorrect result). 

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: Yes

Value entry examples::

* The model is only valid between 0 and 50 degrees

* Not real-time capable

* The model provides incorrect results at low speeds

* Eddy currents are neglected

* Thermal effects are not considered

* Linear

* org.modelica.causality.acausal

* org.iso.is11010-1.vhm.2-1

=== Verification status

Attribute description::  Indicates whether a given verification procedure has been followed to successfully reach verification criteria. Verification permits to confirm that a simulation technically works (code without bug, convergence of discretized models, etc.).

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* has been verified

* has not be verified

Additional explanation and rationale:: Incentive to verify the model. As verification can cover various aspects, rely on various techniques and be more or less constraining, details should be provided with the attribute "Verification & Validation procedure and criteria" and "Verification & Validation report".

=== Validation status

Validation permits to confirm that a simulation fulfills user needs. For example, validation permits to confirm that a simulation is close enough to a reference given particular needs.

Filling:: Recommended

Can have multiple values:: No

Value entry examples::

* has been validated

* has not been validated

* validated with limitations

Additional explanation and rationale:: Incentive to validate the model. As validation can cover various aspects, rely on various techniques and be more or less constraining, details should be provided with the attribute "Verification & Validation procedure and criteria" and "Verification & Validation report".
